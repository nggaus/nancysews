          <h1>About Nancy</h1>
          <img src="img/mommy.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 300px;"/>
          <p>My mom, also a seamstress, taught me to sew when I was five years old.  I took to it right away and starting making my own clothes
          when I was in kindergarten.  By the time I got to high school, I was merging patterns to make new designs and adding all sorts of
          creative touches.  An avid crafter, I was also improving my skills in knitting, crocheting, weaving, macrame, tatting and any other
          textile-based craft I could get my hands on. </p>

          <p>I took a long break from sewing when I went to college for a degree in Electrical Engineering, then worked for several years in
          the electronics industry.  Only after a few years in graduate school and some time starting a family did I return to the business
          of sewing.  I gained
          a lot of experience working for Keely's Bridal in Baldwinsville as a seamstress doing alterations on bridal and formal wear.  Working
          part time as a seamstress instead of full time as an engineer allowed me to spend time with my family and do volunteer work with both
          Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.  I also tried my hand at teaching sewing classes at JoAnn Fabrics and discovered that I really enjoy teaching.
          I now work for myself doing alterations for friends, neighbors, and a local dance studio. I also plan to teach classes at Stacey Kate,
          a local Baldwinsville boutique.  </p>
