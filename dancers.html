          <h1>Dance Costume Alterations for RRDC</h1>
          <p>
            If you need me to look at your costumes, check my schedule below and contact me via my Email address on the <a href="contact.html">
            Contact</a> page. I frequent the studio during January and February, so you can also reach me there if you know when I plan to visit.
            </br>
            </br>
            <strong>For the month of January: </strong></br>
	    Appointments available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.</br>
	    I can do fittings in the afternoon 
	    before 5:30 or in the evening after 6:30 PM.  If I know the studio will be especially hectic during your fitting I may ask if you 
            would be able to meet at the Stacy Kate boutique on Mechanic Street rather than the dance studio.
	    </br>
	    </br>
	    <strong>For the month of February: </strong></br>
	    Appointments as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will try to get costumes back within a week, but will also try to accommodate urgent deadlines. Unless I contact you for a second fitting, 
            I will drop the costumes off in the studio and Email you to let you know the work is finished. 
          </p>
	  <p>
	    I will try to give you a price quote for my work at the initial fitting.  Most costume alterations range from $5-$25 depending on the 
	    complexity of the work.  Payments should be left at the front desk.  I prefer cash
	    payments but will take checks from repeat customers.
          <p/>
          <p>
            Although I used to make costumes from scratch, I found that they were very labor intensive and the time spent on them put me behind
            in my other work.  Since costumes are readily available on-line, it seems more prudent and cost effective to purchase them from 
            resellers and have me alter or adjust them for you.  I will still consider making parts of costumes such as trunks and skirts, or 
            amending and embellishing costumes, 
            but materials for these endeavors may be limited since I rarely get to NYC where supplies are more readily available.
          </p>
	  <p>
	    <strong>Interested in doing the work yourself but don't know where to start?</strong>  I can give you pointers and tips to 
	    get you on your way.
