<!-- TIMESTAMP -->
          <div class="updates" style="background-color:#b3ffff">
          <p>Last update -- 04:28 PM, 3/27/20 &nbsp;  Minor updates about addtional nose piece options (and how to add them to rectangular masks)</p>
          
          <p>Update -- 02:23 PM, 3/27/20 &nbsp; I have an alternative nose piece solution for the "Upstate" shaped mask. Updated instructions for use with this new
          piece are available <a href="support/UpdatedAssembly.pdf" style="color:darkred; font-weight:800">here</a>.  These instructions include information on how to fabricate your own nose pieces out of
          aluminum roof flashing.  You may want to take a look at these instructions even if you are using pipe cleaners, twist ties, or floral wire since the assembly order might be more to your liking.<br><br>
          
          <strong>ALSO</strong> -- I am working with the Syracuse tech community to have them create a website where area healthcare centers can submit a request for masks, and area sewists can grab orders
          and run with them.  It is being rolled out in stages.  I will let everyone know as this resource comes online.</p>

          <h2>Hello to my friends in central New York</h2>
          
            <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn
            masks as a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            <p>There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort for central New York (maybe, but I haven’t been able to find any).  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            <p>I am finally getting answers.  As of this writing, SUNY Upstate is beginning to take donations from people who are willing and able to make masks.  There is a hospital committee that has looked
            into the materials and design needed to make them as safe as possible for their healthcare workers to use.  I have posted their information below. </p>
            <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this page and try to make it more widely available.   &nbsp; -Nancy</p>
            
      
            <p><strong>LET'S STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY OUT THERE.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS FABULOUS SEWING COMMUNITY.  USE CDC GUIDELINES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PRACTICE FREQUENT
            HANDWASHING.  WE NEED YOU HEALTHY!</strong></p>

          <img src="img/surgMask_114x90.png">
          
          <p>First, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVnocKNgEPNSC4DRp0QV-kKfSrPmVMsczMuq1kcIUxNA8DmvG5PS5S0e8zuPRFNe0VnlGzd6segMsl/pub?fbclid=IwAR291s1Don-8l60We8s9nHcUxpxH-Yb3Aaj3DYYWWad9urQRNwJsTv5Xjks">here</a> is some basic information from the Open-Source COVID19 Situation and Supply Needs (OSCMS) group.  They emphaize that you should be working with a group
            that is using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is nothing set up in your area.
            I am slowly finding groups in central New York and as I find them, I will list them below. If you know of active groups that would like assistance, please let me know and I will add
            them along with their contact information to my list.</p>
            
            <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">document</a> also has a
            list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information
            on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
          <article class="blog-entry">
          <h2>Questions that you probably have that I think I have answers for:</h2>
          <ul class="plain-list">
            <li><strong>How do I know I have the right materials in my stash?</strong><br>
            Current instructions are calling for tightly woven, prewashed cotton (quilting cotton will do), flannel if you have it (for filling), either narrow flat elastic or elastic cord OR self fabric ties, and, if you are making shaped masks, you will need a nose piece (see below)</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>I don’t have the materials at home.  Where can I get them?</strong><br>
              Once you know what materials are acceptable (ask a working group or check approved instruction sheets), you can purchase locally from stores listed below.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>I know how to sew but I don’t have a machine.  Where can I get one?</strong><br>
              Ask friends and neighbors if they have any old machines in their closets.  As long as it can sew a solid straight stitch, you’re good.  If you can’t get your
              hands on one, then pair up with someone who does and offer to cut out fabric pieces or make a run to the fabric store for supplies (for front porch drop offs).
              Most fabric stores are now offering curb-side service.<br><br>
              If you are really at a loss, you can sew the masks by hand.  Make sure they are sturdy enough to stand up to repeated washing, though.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>What design should I use and are there instructions?</strong> <br>
            There are many designs out there.  SUNY Upstate has released their <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/masks">instruction sheet</a> for a close fitting, shaped mask, and I have an
            <a href="support/UpdatedAssembly.pdf">updated version</a> (uses the same pattern pieces) that will work with a flat aluminum nose piece (see below).  SUNY Upstate will be
            distributing any extra of these sewn masks to other hospitals in Syracuse.<br><br>
            
            If you are a "sloppy sewer" (hey, I don't judge!) then go for the rectangular mask since it's easier to sew.  But if you have some decent sewing chops, try the shaped mask since it is
            what the hospitals prefer.<br><br>
            
            Beth Eischen Call has these great <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">instructions</a> for the rectangular masks she is making for
            distribution to medical labs and other healthcare facilities.  If you want to add a wire or metal strip to a rectangular mask to make a better fit, see this <a href="support/NosePieceOptions.pdf">information sheet</a> with tips on adding a casing to the top edge of your rectangular masks.</a><br><br>
            
            Some people are finding that the elastic ear straps are loose on some people.  For this reason, I am starting to make fabric straps to tie behead the head instead.  If anyone knows for sure that <strong>ear loops</strong> are preferred over tying behind the head, please let me know. <br><br>
            
            <a href="https://www.weneedmasks.org/">WeNeedMasks.org</a> has information at the national level.  Their designs <em>may</em> be suitable for healthcare facilities other than
            SUNY Upstate, but check first before you sew.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Where do I take them when I have a bunch made?</strong><br>
              We need to minimize traffic at the hospitals.  Some collection points are listed below.

            <li><strong>Nose pieces:</strong>  There are a number of things you can use for nose pieces on the shaped masks.  Some people are using pipe cleaners or twist ties (as mentioned above).

You can use either a pair of metal snips or heavy scissors. Nip off the corners so they are more "user friendly" and slide into the casing easier.  The more accurate you make the ¼” cut the better -- these need to slide into a narrow casing and if they are too wide, they won’t fit!  If the edges seem sharp, you can sand them lightly, but I’ve found this to be unnecessary.</li>
