          <h1>Syracuse Needs Locally Sewn Masks</h1>
          
<!-- TIMESTAMP -->
          <div class="updates" style="background-color:#b3ffff">
          <p><strong>Last Update</strong> -- 11:30 AM, 3/28/20 &nbsp; Some of you have been having trouble accessing the orginal Upstate instructions which include the pattern for
          the shaped mask.  I lifted those pattern pieces and added them to the <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns.pdf">updated instructions</a> so that they are now available
          in both places.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Update</strong> -- 11:40 PM, 3/27/20 &nbsp;  I have fabricated a bunch of nose pieces for the shaped "Upstate" masks and they are available for sewists in the Baldwinsville and Liverpool
          area.  I have them packaged in lots of 16.  If you are local, you can pick up a package from a box on the front porch at 3220 Far Reach Drive (top of Radisson).  If you
          are not local, there are instructions at the bottom of this page for how to make them yourself.  If someone else in the Syracuse area is willing to make these pieces as instructed below&#10038;,
          you can leave them at Calico Gals on New Court Avenue in their donation bin.  Package them in lots of 16 or 20.</p>
          
          <p><strong>PLUS</strong> -- I made a lot of updates to this page.  You might want to skim through it if you've been here before.<br><br>
          
          <strong>ALSO</strong> -- I am working with the Syracuse tech community to have them create a website where area healthcare centers can submit a request for masks, and area sewists can see where the need is.
          It is being rolled out this weekend.  I will let everyone know as this resource comes online.<br><br>
          
          <strong>PLEASE</strong> -- If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to someone who is sick, please wait until you are recovered and out of danger before sewing masks!

          <h2>Hello to my friends in central New York</h2>
          
            <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn
            masks as a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            <p>There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort for central New York (maybe, but I haven’t been able to find any).  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            <p>I am finally getting answers.  As of this writing, SUNY Upstate is beginning to take donations from people who are willing and able to make masks.  There is a hospital committee that has looked
            into the materials and design needed to make them as safe as possible for their healthcare workers to use.  I have posted their information below. </p>
            <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this page and try to make it more widely available.   &nbsp; -Nancy</p>
            
      
            <p><strong>LET'S STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY OUT THERE.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS FABULOUS SEWING COMMUNITY.  USE CDC GUIDELINES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PRACTICE FREQUENT
            HANDWASHING.  WE NEED YOU HEALTHY!</strong></p>

          <p>First, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVnocKNgEPNSC4DRp0QV-kKfSrPmVMsczMuq1kcIUxNA8DmvG5PS5S0e8zuPRFNe0VnlGzd6segMsl/pub?fbclid=IwAR291s1Don-8l60We8s9nHcUxpxH-Yb3Aaj3DYYWWad9urQRNwJsTv5Xjks">here</a> is some basic information from the Open-Source COVID19 Situation and Supply Needs (OSCMS) group.  They emphaize that you should be working with a group
            that is using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is nothing set up in your area.
            I am slowly finding groups in central New York and as I find them, I will list them below. If you know of active groups that would like assistance, please let me know and I will add
            them along with their contact information to my list.</p>
            
            <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">document</a> also has a
            list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information
            on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
          <article class="blog-entry">
          <h2>Questions that you probably have that I think I have answers for:</h2>
          <ul class="plain-list">
            <li><strong>How do I know I have the right materials in my stash?</strong><br>
            Current instructions are calling for tightly woven, <em>prewashed</em> cotton (quilting cotton will do), <em>prewashed</em> flannel if you have it (for filling), either
            narrow flat elastic or elastic cord OR self fabric ties (ties are probably better because they are adjustable), and, if you are making shaped masks, you will need a nose
            piece (see below).</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>I don’t have the materials at home.  Where can I get them?</strong><br>
              You can purchase locally from stores listed below or order online. JoAnn Fabrics is now offering curb-side service if you order ahead. </li><br>
              
            <li><strong>I know how to sew but I don’t have a machine.  Where can I get one?</strong><br>
              Ask friends and neighbors if they have any old machines in their closets.  As long as it can sew a solid straight stitch, you’re good.  If you can’t get your
              hands on one, then pair up with someone who does have one and offer to cut out fabric pieces or make a run to the fabric store for supplies (for front porch drop offs).
              JoAnn Fabrics is now offering curb-side service if you order ahead.<br><br>
              If you are really at a loss, you can sew the masks by hand.  Make sure they are sturdy enough to stand up to repeated washing though.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>What design should I use and are there instructions?</strong> <br>
            There are many designs out there.  SUNY Upstate has released their <a href="support/UpstateOriginal.pdf">instruction sheet</a> for a close fitting, shaped mask which they prefer.
            I have an
            <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns.pdf">updated version</a> of these instructions (uses the same pattern pieces) that will work with a flat aluminum nose piece.  You may want to take a look
            at the updated version even if you are using pipe cleaners, heavy twist ties, or floral wire for your nose piece since this alternate assembly method might be more to your liking.  SUNY Upstate will be
            distributing any extra of these sewn masks to other hospitals in Syracuse.<br><br>
            
            If you are a "sloppy sewer" (hey, I don't judge!) then go for the rectangular mask since it's easier to sew.  But if you have some reasonable sewing chops, try the shaped mask since it is
            what the hospitals prefer.  They are going to need lots of them!<br><br>
            
            Beth Eischen Call has these great <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">instructions</a> for the rectangular masks she is making for
            distribution to medical labs and other healthcare facilities.  If you want to add a wire or metal strip to a rectangular mask to make a better fit, see this <a href="support/NosePieceOptions.pdf">information sheet</a> with tips on adding a casing to the top edge of your masks.</a><br><br>
            
            Some people are reporting that the elastic ear straps are too loose on some people.  For this reason, I am starting to make fabric straps that tie behead the head instead.  If anyone knows for sure that <strong>ear loops</strong> are preferred over tying behind the head, please let me know. Regardless, fabric straps (in lieu of elastic) are now being requested by many facilities.<br><br>
            
            <a href="https://www.weneedmasks.org/">WeNeedMasks.org</a> has information at the national level.  Their designs may be suitable for healthcare facilities other than
            SUNY Upstate, but check first before you sew.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>Where do I take them when I have a bunch made?</strong><br>
              We need to minimize traffic at the hospitals.  Some collection points are listed below.
            </li><br>
              
            <li><strong>But cloth masks are not sterile.  Can they really be used?</strong><br>
              At this point, due to extreme shortages, the CDC is loosening it's guidelines and allowing healthcare centers to use cloth masks.  It's better than going without.  In some
              situations, the cloth masks can be used over top of the approved sterile masks to extend their lifespan.  In other situations, the cloth masks will be the only thing
              available.  Be sure to <em>prewash</em> your fabrics before making the masks, thoroughly wash your hands before working on them, clean your sewing area, and pack completed
              masks in plastic bags or boxes for delivery.  Healthcare centers will probably be washing them before use.  <em>If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to someone
              who is sick, please wait until you are recovered and out of danger before sewing masks!!</em>
