          <h1>Syracuse Needs Locally Sewn Masks</h1>
          
<!-- TIMESTAMP -->
          <p>Last update -- 01:09 PM, 3/26/20</p>
          
          <h2>Hello to my friends in central New York</h2>
          
            <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn
            masks as a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            <p>There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort for central New York (maybe, but I haven’t been able to find any).  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            <p>I am finally getting answers.  As of this writing, SUNY Upstate is beginning to take donations from people who are willing and able to make masks.  There is a hospital committee that has looked
            into the materials and design needed to make them as safe as possible for their healthcare workers to use.  I have posted their information below. </p>
            <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this page and try to make it moe widely available.   &nbsp; -Nancy</p>
            
      
            <p><strong>LET'S STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY OUT THERE.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS FABULOUS SEWING COMMUNITY.  USE CDC GUIDELINES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PRACTICE FREQUENT
            HANDWASHING.  WE NEED YOU HEALTHY!</strong></p>

          <img src="img/surgMask_114x90.png">
          
          <p>First, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVnocKNgEPNSC4DRp0QV-kKfSrPmVMsczMuq1kcIUxNA8DmvG5PS5S0e8zuPRFNe0VnlGzd6segMsl/pub?fbclid=IwAR291s1Don-8l60We8s9nHcUxpxH-Yb3Aaj3DYYWWad9urQRNwJsTv5Xjks">here</a> is some basic information from the Open-Source COVID19 Situation and Supply Needs (OSCMS) group.  They emphaize that you should be working with a group
            that is using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is nothing set up in your area.
            I am slowly finding finding groups in central New York and as I find them, I will list them below. If you know of active groups that would like assistance, please let me know and I will add
            them along with their contact information to my list.</p>
            
            <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">document</a> also has a
            list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information
            on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p>

            I will be following the instructions and patterns for shaped masks as outlined in SUNY Upstate's <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/masks">How to Make Facemasks</a> and will try
            to acquire a supply of nose pieces for local seamstresses in Baldwinsville. In the meantime, use a 5" length of pipecleaner.  I'll also serve as a local dropoff spot for finished masks.
            There will be a dropoff bin on my front porch for finished masks.  Please leave your name and contact
            information with your donation.</li><br>
            
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.sewcreativefairport.com/">Sew Creative</a></strong>, in Fairport, New York, is making masks and accepting donations of cotton fabric. They would prefer it cut. Each mask
            requires a 7 1/2" x 15" cut piece plus a 2" x 6" strip. You can make packs of 10, including ten 7 1/2" x 15" pieces and one 2" x 60" strip. They can be dropped off at the store in Fairport.
            The store also has a link on its website on how to make these masks.</li><br>

<!-- FAQ -->
          <article class="blog-entry">
          <h2>Questions that you probably have that I think I have answers for:</h2>
          <ul class="plain-list">
            <li><strong>How do I know I have the right materials in my stash?</strong><br>
            Current instructions are calling for tightly woven, prewashed cotton (quilting cotton will do), flannel if you have it (for lining), narrow flat elastic or elastic cord, and some require a 5"
            nosepiece which is in limited supply locally (Note: You can substitute a heavy garden twist tie or pipe cleaner if necessary).  If you don't have elastic, you may be able to replace it with narrow ties made from the cotton fabric.</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>I don’t have the materials at home.  Where can I get them?</strong><br>
              Once you know what materials are acceptable (ask a working group or check approved instruction sheets), you can purchase locally from stores listed below.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>I know how to sew but I don’t have a machine.  Where can I get one?</strong><br>
              Ask friends and neighbors if they have any old machines in their closets.  As long as it can sew a solid straight stitch, you’re good.  If you can’t get your
              hands on one, then pair up with someone who does and offer to cut out fabric pieces or make a run to the fabric store for supplies (for front porch drop offs).
              Most fabric stores are now offering curb-side service.<br><br>
              If you are really at a loss, you can sew the masks by hand.  Make sure they are sturdy enough to stand up to repeated washing, though.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>What design should I use and are there instructions?</strong> <br>
            There are many designs out there.  SUNY Upstate has just released their <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/masks">instruction sheet</a> for a close fitting shaped mask.  They will be
            distributing any extra of these sewn masks to other hospitals in Syracuse.<br><br>
            Beth Eischen Call has these great <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">instructions</a> for the masks she is making for
            distribution to medical labs and other healthcare facilities.<br><br>
            <a href="https://www.weneedmasks.org/">WeNeedMasks.org</a> has information at the national level.  Their designs <em>may</em> be suitable for healthcare facilities other than
            SUNY Upstate, but check first before you sew.</li><br>
<!--              From OSCMS, there is this basic <a href="https://www.project-cloth-masks.com/">design</a>.<br>
              From a California home-dec business, there is this basic <a href="https://decortoadore.net/2020/03/how-to-sew-hospital-face-masks.html">design</a>.</li><br>  -->
              
              
            <li><strong>Where do I take them when I have a bunch made?</strong><br>
              We need to minimize traffic at the hospitals.  Some collection points are listed below.
