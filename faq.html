          <ul class="faq">
            <li>
              <span>What kind of work do you do?</span><br/>
              <p>
                I've done many different sorts of projects over the years.  The majority of my work involves
                altering off-the-rack clothing, from taking in a favorite tank top to fitting a formal dress
                for the prom.  I do a lot of home decor projects as well.  I have made curtain panels, recovered
                cushions, and made custom pillows.  I've made a few Halloween costumes over the years.  Although I don't
                do any quilting, I've mended several finished quilts.<br/><br/>
                From late December until early March, I work with a local dance studio to alter ready-to-wear costumes
                for a custom fit.   From early April to the end of May, my business focuses on altering prom formals.
                I handle bridal alterations throughout the year.
              </p>

            <li>
              <span>What kind of work don't you do?</span><br/>
              <p>
                Although I used to work on some really big custom projects, I find that if a project takes <span class="bad">more than a couple of days to complete, it puts me
                too far behind</span> in my other work.  I don't make a lot of money on big custom projects because
                my standards are high, and I invest a lot of hours into them.  If I charge normal rates for the
                time I put into them, you wouldn't be able to afford me!  Since I end up earning below minimum
                wage on these jobs, I do them simply for the joy of creating and limit the number I take in
                during the year.  That's why I make only a handful of dance costumes each year, and I don't make
		custom clothing at all.<br/><br/>
                Certain fabrics will never enter my workroom.  If a <span class="bad">fabric sheds glitter or fuzz readily,</span> then
                I will not work with it.  My workroom is in my home, and since these projects typically take a bit
                longer because of special handling, the wayward bits and fluff gets all over my house.<br/>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <span>Do I come to your home/studio for fittings?</span><br/>
              <p>
                Typically not.  I find that most people are available for fittings late on weekday afternoons or in
                the evenings when my family is home.  Since I have a small house, my fitting area is also where
                my family spends time and I don't like the two to overlap.  It is easier for me to come to you,
                especially if you live within Baldwinsville, Liverpool or Clay (within 10 miles of my work studio).
                I find that people are often more comfortable trying on clothes in their own homes anyway.
              </p>
	      <p>
	  	Starting this year, I will also be offering fittings by appointment at a local boutique in Baldwinsville, 
		Stacy Kate, located at 6 Mechanic Street next to Nami's Engraving.

            <li>
              <span>Do I pay up front or put a deposit down for work you are doing for me?</span><br/>
              <p>
                I prefer you pay me when the work is finished and you are happy with the results.  I ask that
                you pay in cash when I deliver the work.  If I know you and you are a solid repeat customer
                I will take a check.
              </p>
            </li>

	    <li>
              <span>Do you offer sewing lessons?</span><br/>
              <p>
                I have been teaching one-on-one lessons to friends, but I now have facilities available to teach small groups.
                If you are interested in lessons, please see my <a href="teaching.html">classes</a> page to learn more and sign up.
                Most classes will be held at the Stacy Kate boutique in Baldwinsville.
